Examples

- [three.js](./threejs/index.html)
- [three.js (worker)](./threejs-worker/index.html)
- [SVG](./svg/index.html)
- [SVG (worker)](./svg-worker/index.html)
- [ogl](./ogl/index.html)

Note: all of the examples _except for ogl_ can be run by downloading the repository and opening the relevant `index.html` in browser. ogl requires a local server of some kind for loading modules due to local CORS restrictions. Recommended usage is:

```
cd examples/ogl
serve .
```
